		First, we would like to thank our supervisor Harald Haberstroh and our client at the University of Technology, Wolfgang Kastner. Without you, this would not have been possible, and not nearly as interesting. Especially, we thank Harald for putting up with us using not a single piece of technology he had known before.
	
	Of course, many thanks also go to our families. Without your support, it would have been impossible for us to stay the course for the entire time. We also deeply appreciate your corrections and helpful tips.
	
	Lastly, we would also like to thank our entire class. This were by far our most fun years at school, and we don't think there has ever been another class with nearly the same attitude as our's.
