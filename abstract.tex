The main goal behind Sombrero is the creation of an open source KNX management tool. Management in this sense is not the configuration of KNX devices, but rather control of them in a structured and user-friendly way.

To present users with a simple interface, it was decided to use a web service, accessible through a web browser, as a front-end. To further ease the adoption through end users, experiences with standard software, most notably heavy use of mouse clicks and drag \& drop, should be applicable in the web interface. To avoid confusion of the end user by management control elements, user management and designated administrator users with extended control capabilities were added.

In order to speed up development, an agile and dynamic approach to project management was taken, and an adopted version of the Getting Real process model was used. To minimize implementation time and error-proneness, the programming language Scala, the JavaScript framework JQuery and the web framework Lift were used.\ref{Iterations}
